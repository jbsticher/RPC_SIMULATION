# RPC SIMULATION

Tired of the old rock, paper, and scissors game and want to see them battle it out on the playing field? Then look no further....

## Installation

First, freeze all of your pip packages in the requirements.txt file using the command

pip freeze > requirements.txt

This should create the requirements.txt file in the correct format. Then try installing using the command

pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you're in the same folder as the file when running this command.

If you get some path name instead of the version number in the requirements.txt file, use this pip command to work around it.

pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt

IF THIS SEEMS LIKE TOO MUCH ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED IS:

pip install pygame from a command line.

## HAVE FUN!
